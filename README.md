# Twisha Shriyam Research Lab – Stellar Journey to Mastery

Welcome to **Twisha Shriyam Research Lab’s** Stellar Journey to Mastery project repository.

This repo tracks a full progression through the **Stellar Journey to Mastery: Monthly Builder Challenges** – from basic wallets to a production‑style dApp with real users and metrics.

> Tracks covered:
> - 🥋 **Builder Track (Belts)** – Levels 1–6
> - 🚀 **Open Source Track** – High‑impact contributions to Stellar‑native projects

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a research & engineering sandbox under **Twisha Shriyam Research Lab**, focused on:

- Learning Stellar and Soroban by **shipping real dApps**.
- Iteratively evolving one codebase from:
  - ⚪️ Wallet + first transaction →  
  - ⚫️ Production‑ready application with metrics, security, and Demo Day pitch.
- Optionally contributing back to the ecosystem via the **Open Source Track**.

At a high level, the app evolves through these phases:

- **Level 1–2** – Simple payment dApp → multi‑wallet + basic Soroban contract + events.
- **Level 3–4** – Mini dApp with tests, caching, CI/CD, mobile responsiveness, advanced contracts.
- **Level 5–6** – Real MVP with users, feedback, metrics, monitoring, security, advanced features (e.g., fee sponsorship or multi‑sig).

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript, Vite or Next.js.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS / Chakra UI (mobile‑first responsive design).
- **Wallets:**  
  - Freighter, xBull, Albedo (via `@creit.tech/stellar-wallets-kit`).
- **Blockchain / Smart Contracts:**
  - Stellar testnet / Futurenet.
  - Soroban smart contracts (Rust).
- **Backend / Indexer (later belts):**
  - Node.js or Python service for event ingestion + indexing.
  - PostgreSQL / Supabase for storing indexed data and metrics.
- **Tooling & Infrastructure (later belts):**
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
  - Vercel / Netlify for deployments.
  - Sentry / similar for monitoring & error tracking.

## 3. Builder Track – Belt Progression

### 3.1 Belt Levels (Program Summary)

This repo follows the official **Belt System** of the Builder Track:

| Belt | Level | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| ⚪️ White | 1 | Wallets & first testnet transactions |
| 🟡 Yellow | 2 | Multi‑wallet flows, Soroban contracts, event handling |
| 🟠 Orange | 3 | Fully working mini dApp, tests, caching, demo video |
| 🟢 Green | 4 | Advanced contracts + production readiness (CI/CD, mobile) |
| 🔵 Blue | 5 | Real MVP + at least 5 testnet users |
| ⚫️ Black | 6 | Scale to 20–30+ users, metrics, security, monitoring, Demo Day |
